Adverse events identified by intervening practitioners are considered unlikely. Should the participant become distressed, the intervening practitioner will debrief the participant and sign post him or her to appropriate support services. Any adverse events that are observed will be reported to the steering committee, who will consider the criteria for discontinuing or modifying the allocated intervention.
