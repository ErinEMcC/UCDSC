CS has grants with Adverum, the Alpha-1 Foundation, CSL Behring, Grifols, and Baxalta/Shire and has consulted for Grifols, Adverum and CSL Behring in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and has an equity interest in Abeona. Computed tomography (CT) lung density is an accepted biomarker for emphysema in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), although concerns for radiation exposure limit its longitudinal use. Serum proteins associated with emphysema, particularly in early disease, may provide additional pathogenic insights. We investigated whether distinct proteomic signatures characterize the presence and progression of emphysema in individuals with severe AATD and normal forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). QUANTitative lung CT UnMasking emphysema progression in AATD (QUANTUM-1) is a multicenter, prospective 3-year study of 49 adults with severe AATD and FEV1 post-bronchodilator values (Post-BD) \u2265 80% predicted. All participants received chest CT, serial spirometry, and contributed to the serum biobank. Volumetric imaging display and analysis (VIDA) software defined the baseline 15th percentile density (PD15) which was indexed to CT-derived total lung capacity (TLC). We measured 317 proteins using a multiplexed immunoassay (Myriad Discovery MAP\u00ae panel) in 31 individuals with a complete dataset. We analyzed associations between initial PD15/TLC, PD15/TLC annual decline, body mass index (BMI), and protein levels using Pearson\u2019s product moment correlation. C-reactive protein (CRP), adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AFBP), leptin, and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) were found to be associated with baseline emphysema and all but leptin were associated with emphysema progression after adjustments were made for age and sex. All 4 proteins were associated with BMI after further adjustment for multiple comparisons was made. The relationship between these proteins and BMI, and further validation of these findings in replicative cohorts require additional studies.",
