Tacit assent was interpreted by the absence of any signs of distress, negative facial expression, or other behavioral indicators, which were monitored throughout. If indicators were that a child did not assent, the session was terminated; if a child did not assent for three consecutive sessions, participation was suspended and not recommenced without a review with child and parent at a later date.

Both studies were funded by Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH (https://www.pieris.com/). The phase I study in health volunteers was supported financially by the Eurocalin fund FP7-HEALTH.2011.1.4.3 (EUROpean Consortium for antiCALINs as next generation high-affinity protein therapeutics, https://www.bio-m.org/en/news/news-detail/munich-and-europe-european-eurocalin-consortiumwith-a-strong-munich-hallmark.html). Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH provided the study protocols based on the input from the authors of this manuscript, and the sponsor oversight according to GCP guidelines. Volunteers/patients were recruited by the phase 1 unit of Nuvisan GmbH for the healthy volunteers study and by the clinical centers (authors affiliations) for the CKD study. MVZ DaVita as a dialysis unit also recruited patients in the CKD study (affiliation of Prof. Dellana). Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH paid the per patient costs. Data analysis was performed by a CRO (Nuvisan GmbH for the healthy volunteers study and FGK for the CKD study) based on the study protocol on behalf of Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH. Hepcidin analysis was performed by hepcidinanalysis.com on behalf of Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH. The data and study reports were reviewed and commented upon by the authors of this publication, who also participated in writing and reviewing the manuscript.
